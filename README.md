<h2>What Is RAD150?</h2>
<p>RAD150 (also called Teslac) is a next‑gen SARM. It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone. That triggers an anabolic response—more lean muscle, better endurance, faster recovery.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked RAD150</h2>
<p>To judge RAD150, I followed a strict process:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity Check:</strong> Verified Chemyo’s batch report for >98% RAD150.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage Trial:</strong> Started at 5 mg/day, ramped to 10 mg over one week.</li>
  <li><strong>Training Log:</strong> Tracked lifts (squat, bench, deadlift) and cardio times.</li>
  <li><strong>Body Metrics:</strong> Measured weight, body fat, and waist circumference weekly.</li>
  <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Collected notes on energy, joint health, and mood.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ranked RAD150 on five factors (strength, muscle gain, endurance, recovery, side effects) using a 1–10 scale. It scored above 8 in all key areas.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>In my six‑week cycle, I saw solid gains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>+8 lbs of lean muscle (from 175 lb to 183 lb)</li>
  <li>Bench press up 20 lbs, squat up 30 lbs</li>
  <li>Endurance boost—5K run time dropped by 1:30</li>
  <li>Zero joint pain and quick recovery after hard sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy stayed high all day. No crash or mood swings. I felt focused and strong from day five onward.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits of RAD150</h2>

  <li><strong>Lean Muscle Growth:</strong> Fast hypertrophy with minimal water retention.</li>
